# History
CIFS: released by Mico in 1996 [deprecated] 
SMB 1980 --> CIFS 1996 --> SMB2.0 2006 ---> SMB3.0 2012

# the server
    it uses the samba pkg [a guy reverse-engineered the protocol in 1992]
    samba can do more that making *shares* avail over the network [auth, printing...]
    samba's funcs are implemented using 2 daemons: smbd [authen author, file and print srvs...] , nmbd [name resolution, service anouncement ...]
    it runs entirely as a user program!!! XXX
    with each req to the listening sock, smbd forks itself [after authen and author] and run the new proc as the user specified in the req [it adds file locking for windows compatibility as well to the std ACL of UNIX]
    the config files are in: /etc/samba/smb.conf  [test it with `testparm -v`]
## authen  --> must be done with a user account
    opt 1)
        local authen: create a local user account on the UNIX server 
        use the `sudo smbpasswd -a <user>` cmd to set the passwd for the user windows style
        outside users cannot change the passwds without remote access to the server
        in the config ---> `security  = <local-unix-user>` sets the user account
                            `workgroup = <smth>`
    opt 2) 
        we do not want to maintain a separate DB of all the smbpasswd hashes...
        see kerberos; LDAP; sssd .....
## config-ing shares
    1. each share needs its own stanza
        [movies]
            path = /opt/shit/tits
            read only = no
        # in this case SAMBA users see the following `\\sambaserver\tits`
    2. sharing home dirs:  $use the magic stanza [homes]$
        [homes]
            comment = all home dirs
            browseable = no           # it would be hidden in the network [gotta look for it]
            valid users = %S          # each one can access their respective home dirs
                    #### tangent  [CSV]
                        valid users  can be = to  --> usernames[spock], groups[captains]
                                wildcards[ja*], @AUTHENTICATED_USERS, nobody|guest[guests],
                                = @allusers, !morocco
                                = %S current auth user
                        or any combination of the above
                    #### endtangent
            read only = no 
        # this config would allow kirk to access `\\smbserver\kirk` as its home dir
    3. for nested shares: the config of the sub-share overwrites the parent one.
        e.g. sharing [homes] and a sub-share inside homes
            XXX [homes] is a catch-all share/opt  [last resort]
